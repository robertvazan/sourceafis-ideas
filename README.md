# SourceAFIS idea blog #

This is a list of ideas for improvements in [SourceAFIS](https://sourceafis.machinezoo.com/) fingerprint recognition algorithm.
It serves as a repository of ideas for future development of SourceAFIS algorithm.
It is also a form of [defensive publishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_publication)
to provide prior art of last resort when search for older prior art fails.
It is pushed to [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/robertvazan/sourceafis-ideas/src)
and [GitHub](https://github.com/robertvazan/sourceafis-ideas).
